# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
In this analysis we worked with Bobby, an HR Analyst that was tasked to perform employee research for Pewlett Hackard. Pewlett Hackard was looking into many employees that will be retiring soon, they are looking into offering retirement packages to those who meet certain criteria and also which positions will need to be filled in the near future. 

We assisted Bobby build an employee database with SQL by applying data modeling, engineering and analysis skills. We aquired the employee data from CSV files since the company was only working with Excel and VBA, now they have updated their methods to use SQL

We also worked on two assigments to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results:
